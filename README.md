# digit-recognition

In this project, I utilized PyTorch to implement a deep learning algorithm for recognizing handwritten digits, leveraging the MNIST dataset. This dataset comprises 70,000 handwritten digits, split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a test dataset, with the accuracy of predictions being calculated and displayed. Additionally, the project includes a function to predict labels for individual images and visualize the first correctly and incorrectly classified images from the test set.
